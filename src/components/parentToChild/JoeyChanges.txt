This is how FetchAPI.js and child.js work.

FetchAPI has a class titled GithubFetch. This does two things:
1. Get data from Github via the Github API 
2. Filter the search results via the URL 

Fetch API then passes the data as an object to child.js

child.js maps over the object and displays the relevant info. 

FOR WHOEVER IS MAKING SEARCH/FILTER:
You can either code the filter/search bar directly into FetchAPI.js, 
or make a component that passes the filter to FetchAPI.js.
I think the easiest way to do it would be to put the filter directly
into FetchAPI.js, which can then access the filter directly, use it with the URL, 
and pass data to child.js.

FOR WHOEVER NEEDS TO DISPLAY GITHUB INFO (name, number of stars, etc.):
You can either code that directly into child.js, 
or make child.js pass the info you need into your own component
